Branch: "feature/signal-handling"
- handle SIGINT (Ctrl-C): clean up + shut down
- ignore SIGPIPE to prevent crash on writing to disconnected clients.
Global shutdown flag or Server pointer

Update Server::run() to respect shutdown
void Server::shutdown();  // Close all client sockets, set _running = false
Server:
add:
	bool _runningMainLoop for main loop
changed:
	RUN():
		main loop in run(0 for handling signals)
		moved incrementng logik pollFdIndex++  from handleClientInput()
handleClientInput():
	pollFdIndex++ removed from function . Logic in one place = >inside run, not this functio

04.07
DONE:
	made a new folder called commands
	took all the command functions (like handlePass, handleNick, etc.) out of the big Server and Client files
	put each command into its own small .cpp files inside the commands folder
	made the project look cleaner and easier to understand
	cChanged the functions so they get the Server as input when they need it
	fixed the code so things like sendToClient and getServerName still work after moving the functions

		isValidUsername()


Client:
	changed:
		removed bool _isRegistered to isRegistered() inside function
		moved  some Orthodox Canonical Form to private (Client objects are non-copyable in real-world servers)

	added:

	moved constructors to private, because only 1 server according to subject
	made isValid password static to check also server subject
	deleted operator<<(need debug only)
	changed check arguments in main, organized

CLIENT:

branch server-client handling

[x] sendToClient()
 
 [x]removeClient(fd) properly. It only does:
    Close fd
    Erase from _clients
    Erase from _pollFds
	
[] Move accept() logic from run() to acceptNewClient()

[] Move read() logic from run() to handleClientInput()
[] Update run() to call these	

28.06
Branch: feat/nick-pass-auth
feat/ → feature work
fix/ → bugfix
test/ → testing logic

27.06
Branch: irc-run-logic

- Input buffering per client
	read() reads available data
	appendToReceivedData() adds it to _receivedData
	While hasCompleteCommandRN() returns true
		extractNextCmd() gets full line (up to \r\n)
		handleCommand() is called with that line

- Wrote: handleCommand()
	Extract command (first word)
	Convert command to uppercase (IRC commands are not case sensitive)
	Split other words as arguments
	Call right function based on command (PASS, NICK, USER, JOIN)

- Server:
	Uncommented function definitions for:
		handlePass()
		handleNick()
		handleUser()
		handleJoin()
		handlePrivateMessage()

- Full line (\r\n) detection works
	Multiple commands handled if sent together

- Command placeholders:
	For now, PASS/NICK/USER/JOIN just reply with "received" message
	PrivateMessage not implemented yet

- Added simple sendToClient() for sending responses

- runpp updated:
	Uses -q 1 for nc so it auto-exits after sending test commands
	Server starts, accepts client, sends basic responses, exits cleanly
